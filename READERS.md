# Bridge Readers

Exposing Bridgeport State Machines to the Real World

## Overview

A Bridge Reader connects as a read-only observer to a MongoDB database that is hosting a State Machine. The bridge then defines configurable HTTPS and SSE endpoints, exposing the data from the State Machine for the world to use.

You should check out the [Hello World Bridge Reader](https://github.com/p2ppsr/hello-world-protocol/tree/master/reader) for an example.
